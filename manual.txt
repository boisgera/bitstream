What is Bitstream ?
================================================================================

Bitstream provides a binary data type with a stream interface 
for [Python] [].

  - **Binary Data:** the `BitStream` class is a linearly ordered container of bits.
    The standard library is only convenient to manage binary data at the byte level. 
    Consider using BitStream instead, especially you need to address the bit level.

  - **Stream Interface:** you can only read data at the start of a stream 
    and write data at its end.
    This is a very simple way to interact with binary data, but it is also
    the pattern that comes naturally in many applications. To manage
    binary codes and formats, in my experience, random data access is 
    not a requirement.

  - **Python and NumPy Types.** BitStream has built-in readers and writers
    for the common data types with a standard binary layout: bools, 
    ASCII strings, fixed-size integers and floating-point integers. 

  - **User-Defined Types.** The list of supported types and binary 
    representation may be enlarged at will: new readers and writers 
    can be implemented and associated to specific data types.

  - **Performance.** Bitstream is a Python C-extension module that has been
    optimized for the common use cases. Hopefully, it will be fast enough 
    for your needs ! Under the hood, the [Cython] [] language and compiler 
    are used to generate this extension module.

  - **Open-Source:** the Bitstream software is distributed under a [MIT license]
    [MIT], its documentation under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0] 
    [CC-BY-3.0] license. The development takes place on [GitHub] [] and 
    releases are also available on [PyPi] [].

Requirements & Installation
================================================================================

Bitstream targets [Python 2.7][], you will need to install it first.

**TODO:** move NumPy dependency here (? Dunno ...), talk about Linux-only platform.

Then, several installation options are available: **TODO:** state clearly
what one should do depending on the aim.

  - **Easy install:** if the [pip][] package manager is available, execute the 
    following command as root:

        $ pip install bitstream

    The dependencies of Bitstream will be handled automatically.
    If you don't have root privileges, use [virtualenv][].

  - **Install from source:** the releases of Bitstream are available
    on the [Python Package Index (PyPi)][PyPi]. Once you have 
    downloaded and unpacked the archive, to build the Bitstream module, 
    you need [setuptools][].
    You also need to install the [NumPy][] package, version 1.6.1 or later.

    **TODO: test if numpy is automatically download if needed**.
 
    Then, as root, execute

        $ python setup.py install

  - **Hack with git:** to experiment with the latest version of Bitstream, 
    clone the GitHub repository:

        $ git clone git://github.com/boisgera/bitstream.git

    To actually build the module, you will need everything you need to build
    from source and will execute the same command. If in addition, you want
    to edit the source files, you will also need the [Cython][] compiler, 
    version 0.15.1 or later and will execute instead:

        $ python setup.py install --with-cython

Getting Started
================================================================================  
    
Most of the features of bitstream are available via the `BitStream` class.

    >>> from bitstream import BitStream

The module is tightly integrated with the [NumPy][NumPy] library. 
For convenience, we import all symbols from its top-level module.

    >>> from numpy import *

[NumPy]: http://www.numpy.org/


Overview of Bitstream Features
================================================================================ 

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> stream.write(True, bool)
    >>> stream
    1
    >>> stream.write(False, bool)
    >>> stream
    10
    >>> stream.write(-128, int8)
    >>> stream
    1010000000
    >>> stream.write("AB", str)
    >>> stream
    10100000000100000101000010
    >>> stream.read(bool, 2)
    [True, False]
    >>> stream
    100000000100000101000010
    >>> stream.read(int8, 1)
    array([-128], dtype=int8)
    >>> stream
    0100000101000010
    >>> stream.read(str, 2)
    'AB'
    >>> stream
    <BLANKLINE>


Built-in Readers and Writers
================================================================================

Bools
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write single bits to a bitstream with the arguments `True` and `False`:

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(False, bool)
    >>> stream.write(True , bool)
    >>> stream
    01

Lists of booleans may be used too write multiple bits at once:

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write([], bool)
    >>> stream
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> stream.write([False], bool)
    >>> stream.write([True] , bool)
    >>> stream
    01
    >>> stream.write([False, True], bool)
    >>> stream
    0101

The second argument to the `write` method -- the type information -- can 
also be specified with the keyword argument `type`:

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(False, type=bool)
    >>> stream.write(True , type=bool)
    >>> stream
    01

For single bools or lists of bools, the type information is optional:

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(False)
    >>> stream.write(True)
    >>> stream.write([])
    >>> stream.write([False])
    >>> stream.write([True])
    >>> stream.write([False, True])
    >>> stream
    010101

Numpy `bool_` scalars or one-dimensional arrays can be used instead:

    >>> bool_
    <type 'numpy.bool_'>
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(bool_(False)  , bool)
    >>> stream.write(bool_(True)   , bool)
    >>> stream
    01

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> empty = array([], dtype=bool)
    >>> stream.write(empty, bool)
    >>> stream
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> stream.write(array([False]), bool)
    >>> stream.write(array([True]) , bool)
    >>> stream.write(array([False, True]), bool)
    >>> stream
    0101

For such data, the type information is also optional:

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(bool_(False))
    >>> stream.write(bool_(True))
    >>> stream.write(array([], dtype=bool))
    >>> stream.write(array([False]))
    >>> stream.write(array([True]))
    >>> stream.write(array([False, True]))
    >>> stream
    010101

Python and Numpy numeric types are also valid arguments: 
zero is considered false and nonzero numbers are considered true.


**Q:** Use a predicate instead (non-zero) ? and check iff ?

    >>> small_integers = range(0, 64)
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> for integer in small_integers:
    ...     stream.write(integer, bool)
    >>> stream
    0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> for integer in small_integers:
    ...     stream.write(-integer, bool)
    >>> stream
    0111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

    >>> large_integers = [2**i for i in range(6, 64)]
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> for integer in large_integers:
    ...     stream.write(integer, bool)
    >>> stream
    1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> for integer in large_integers:
    ...     stream.write(-integer, bool)
    >>> stream
    1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

**TODO:** use iinfo(type).min/max

**TODO:** write `sample(type, r)` iterator.

    >>> def irange(start, stop, r=1.0):
    ...     i = 0
    ...     while i < stop:
    ...         yield i
    ...         i = max(i+1, int(i*r))

    >>> unsigned = [uint8, uint16, uint32]
    >>> for integer_type in unsigned:
    ...     _min, _max = iinfo(integer_type).min, iinfo(integer_type).max
    ...     for i in irange(_min, _max + 1, r=1.001):
    ...         integer = integer_type(i)
    ...         if integer and BitStream(integer, bool) != BitStream(True):
    ...             type_name = integer_type.__name__
    ...             print "Failure for {0}({1})".format(type_name, integer)





    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(0.0, bool)
    >>> stream.write(1.0, bool)
    >>> stream.write(pi , bool)
    >>> stream.write(float64(0.0), bool)
    >>> stream.write(float64(1.0), bool)
    >>> stream.write(float64(pi) , bool)
    >>> stream
    011011

**TODO:** arrays of numeric type (non-bools), written as bools

-----

**TODO:** Mark all following behaviors as undefined ? Probably safer ...

Actually, any single data written as a bool, is conceptually cast into a bool 
first, with the semantics of the `bool` constructor.
List and one-dimensional numpy array arguments are considered holders of 
multiple data, each of which is converted to bool.
Any other sequence type (strings, tuples, etc.) is considered single data.

    >>> bool("")
    False
    >>> bool(" ")
    True
    >>> bool("A")
    True
    >>> bool("AAA")
    True

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write("", bool)
    >>> stream.write(" ", bool)
    >>> stream.write("A", bool)
    >>> stream.write("AAA", bool)
    >>> stream
    0111
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(["", " " , "A", "AAA"], bool)
    >>> stream
    0111
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(array(["", " " , "A", "AAA"]), bool)
    >>> stream
    0111

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(    (), bool)
    >>> stream.write(  (0,), bool)
    >>> stream.write((0, 0), bool)
    >>> stream
    011

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write([[], [0], [0, 0]], bool)
    >>> stream
    011

    >>> class BoolLike(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, value):
    ...         self.value = bool(value)
    ...     def __nonzero__(self):
    ...         return self.value
    >>> false = BoolLike(False)
    >>> true = BoolLike(True)
    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(false, bool)
    >>> stream.write(true, bool)
    >>> stream.write([false, true], bool)
    >>> stream
    0101


TODO: 

  - direct call to `write_bool` (import the symbol first)
  - reader tests


Integers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TODO**


Floating-Point Numbers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>> import struct
    >>> struct.pack(">d", pi)
    '@\t!\xfbTD-\x18'

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> stream.write(0.0)
    >>> stream.write([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    >>> stream.write(arange(4.0, 10.0))
    >>> len(stream)
    640
    >>> output = stream.read(float, 10)
    >>> type(output)
    <type 'numpy.ndarray'>
    >>> all(output == arange(10.0))
    True

    >>> BitStream(1.0) == BitStream(1.0, float) == BitStream(1.0, float64)
    True
    >>> BitStream(1.0) == BitStream([1.0]) == BitStream(ones(1))
    True

The byte order is big endian:
    
    >>> BitStream(struct.pack(">d", pi)) == BitStream(pi)
    True

Extra Methods
================================================================================


**TODO:**:

  - length

  - str, repr

  - _extend ? Make it public ? This is low-level ... but may be necesssary to
    implement new readers/writers. Don't specify it now, as we don't specify
    the offsets / stream state, let the user only rely on the high-level 
    methods.

  - copy

  - hash, comparison.

Custom Writers and Readers
================================================================================

    >>> import bitstream

Definition and Registration of Writers and Readers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's define a writer for the binary representation of natural numbers:

    >>> def write_integer(stream, data):
    ...     if isinstance(data, list):
    ...         for integer in data:
    ...             write_integer(stream, integer)
    ...     else:
    ...         integer = int(data)
    ...         if integer < 0:
    ...             error = "negative integers cannot be encoded"
    ...             raise ValueError(error)
    ...         bools = []
    ...         while integer:
    ...             bools.append(integer & 1)
    ...             integer = integer >> 1
    ...         bools.reverse()
    ...         stream.write(bools, bool)

We can check that this writer behaves as expected:

    >>> stream = BitStream()
    >>> write_integer(stream, 42)
    >>> stream
    101010
    >>> write_integer(stream, [1, 2, 3])
    >>> stream
    10101011011

Then, we can associate it to the type `int`:

    >>> bitstream.register(int, writer=write_integer)

After this step, `BitStream` will redirect all data of type `int` to this writer:

    >>> BitStream(42)
    101010
    >>> BitStream([1, 2, 3])
    11011

If the type information is explicit, other kind of data can use this writer too:

    >>> BitStream(uint8(42), int)
    101010
    >>> BitStream("42", int)
    101010

A possible implementation of the corresponding reader is given by:

    >>> def read_integer(stream, n=None):
    ...     if n is not None:
    ...         error = "unsupported argument n"
    ...         raise NotImplementedError(error)
    ...     else:
    ...         integer = 0
    ...         for _ in range(len(stream)):
    ...             integer = integer << 1
    ...             if stream.read(bool):
    ...                 integer += 1
    ...     return integer

    >>> read_integer(BitStream(42))
    42

Once this reader is registered with

    >>> bitstream.register(int, reader=read_integer)

the calls to `read_integer` can be made through the `read` method of `BitStream`.

    >>> BitStream(42).read(int)
    42

In all readers, the second argument of readers, named `n`, 
represents the number of values to read from the stream. 
Here, this argument is not supported, instead any call to this reader 
interprets the complete stream content as a single value.

Writer and Reader Factories
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We actually had a legitimate reason not to support the number of values argument 
in the binary representation reader. Indeed, when the binary representation 
is used to code sequence of integers instead of a single integer, it becomes 
ambiguous: the same bitstream may represent several sequences of integers. 
For example, we have:

    >>> BitStream(255)
    11111111
    >>> BitStream([15, 15])
    11111111
    >>> BitStream([3, 7, 3, 1])
    11111111
    >>> BitStream([3, 3, 3, 3])
    11111111

We say that this code is not *self-delimiting*, as there is no way to know 
where is the boundary between the bits coding for different integers. 

For natural numbers with known bounds, we may solve this problem by setting
a number of bits to be used for each integer. However, to do that, we
would have to define and register a new writer for every possible number
of bits. Instead, we register a single but configurable writer, defined
by a writer factory.

Let's define a type tag `uint` whose instances hold a number of bits:

    >>> class uint(object):
    ...     def __init__(self, num_bits):
    ...         self.num_bits = num_bits

Then, we define a factory that given a `uint` instance, 
returns a stream writer:

    >>> def write_uint_factory(instance):
    ...     num_bits = instance.num_bits
    ...     def write_uint(stream, data):
    ...         if isinstance(data, list):
    ...             for integer in data:
    ...                 write_uint(stream, integer)
    ...         else:
    ...             integer = int(data)
    ...             if integer < 0:
    ...                 error = "negative integers cannot be encoded"
    ...                 raise ValueError(error)
    ...             bools = []
    ...             for _ in range(num_bits):
    ...                 bools.append(integer & 1)
    ...                 integer = integer >> 1
    ...             bools.reverse()
    ...             stream.write(bools, bool)
    ...     return write_uint

Finally, we register this writer factory with `bitstream`:

    >>> bitstream.register(uint, writer=write_uint_factory)

To select a writer, we use the proper instance of type tag:

    >>> BitStream(255, uint(8))
    11111111
    >>> BitStream(255, uint(16))
    0000000011111111
    >>> BitStream(42, uint(8))
    00101010
    >>> BitStream(0, uint(16))
    0000000000000000


**TODO: reader, give details, comment.**

    >>> def read_uint_factory(instance): # use the name factory ?
    ...     num_bits = instance.num_bits
    ...     def read_uint(stream, n=None):
    ...         if n is None:
    ...             integer = 0
    ...             for _ in range(num_bits):
    ...                 integer = integer << 1
    ...                 if stream.read(bool):
    ...                     integer += 1
    ...             return integer
    ...         else:
    ...             integers = [read_uint(stream) for _ in range(n)]
    ...             return integers
    ...     return read_uint

    >>> bitstream.register(uint, reader=read_uint_factory)

    >>> stream = BitStream([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], uint(8))
    >>> stream.read(uint(8))
    0
    >>> stream.read(uint(8), 1)
    [1]
    >>> stream.read(uint(8), 3)
    [2, 3, 4]


Snapshots (Bitstream state)
================================================================================

(random thought for the moment, fondations for the design of snapshots:)

**TODO:** sort doc material vs dev comments, dispatch, polish.

terms: snapshot (state ?), save, restore.


**Goals:** 

  - for the implementation and error API point of view: give a mechanism to roll
    back all operations that may end up with a "corrupted" stream (stream
    content has changed but cannot deliver what the read asked for), so
    that the mere error scheme that we have now on reader can be upgraded
    to a real exception handling mechansim: if a read fails, the stream
    state hasn't changed.

  - offer the user with read-only and on-demand roll-back features.


Add `save` (returns a (read_offset, write_offset) state) and `restore`
(with state as an argument) or `load` ? We leverage the fact in our
stream model, the data is not immutable, but no information is lost,
only added at the end, so we may always roll back if we need too.

These two methods shall enable a true exception management (not mere
errors, when shit happens, we still have a usable state), AND at the
same time, read-only streams. Maybe higher-level constructs (with
context manager ?) could be useful here to exploit those two schemes.
       
UPDATE: if we want the save / restor NOT TO CRASH, we have to ensure of two
things

  - first that the state stores the id of the stream ... you can't
    restore a state that was not created by you.

  - secondly, as restore + write break the immutability of the stream,
    save/restore pairs should only be applied in reverse order, with
    possible drops in the restore. That should be check by the stream.
    What I mean is that save 1, save 2, restore 2, restore 1 os OK,
    S1, S2, R1 is ok, but S1, S2, R1, S2 is not.

Design: `State` class with ref to the stream attribute, `read_offset`,
`write_offset`, implements the comparison (?). Not that simple. The idea
behind the comparison is that you should always be able to restore an
OLDER snapshot but actually if you think of it, that's older in the 
story of emission of snapshots. So you also have to embed a snapshot 
number and base your comparison on that. As a consequence, bitstream
instances have nothing to store but a snapshot number (the number of
the snapshot that was emitted, or 0 if no snapshot was). No, this is
more complex, requires some thinking. Need to track all restorable
states in the stream ? Maybe ...

**TODO.** basic doctest.
