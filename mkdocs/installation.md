Bitstream supports Python 2.7 and 3.6 to 3.9 on Linux, Windows and MacOS.

We recommend you to install bitstream with pip. 
If for some reason that doesn't work for you 
-- for example if you want to modify the software -- 
you can also install bitstream from sources.

Install with Pip
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Check the following prerequisites 

??? note "Pip"
    The pip package installer should be available

        $ pip --version
        pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (python 3.6)

    Otherwise follow these [instructions][install-pip].

??? note "NumPy"
    Bitstream depends on the [NumPy] package; install it if necessary:

        $ pip install numpy

??? note "C compiler"
    You need a compiler which can work with pip and your version of Python. 
    On Windows, for Python 2.7 you can install the 
    [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7][MSVC].
    For Python 3, a recent Visual Studio compiler (2015 or later)
    should work; you may for example install
    [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

then install bitstream:

    $ pip install bitstream

[pip]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
[install-pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
[NumPy]: http://www.numpy.org/

Install from Sources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Download the Sources

First, download the sources with [git](https://git-scm.com/)
and enter the project directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/boisgera/bitstream
    $ cd bitstream

Alternatively, you can also download the
[project ZIP archive](https://github.com/boisgera/bitstream/archive/master.zip).
For example:
        
    $ wget https://github.com/boisgera/bitstream/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip
    $ cd bitstream-master

### Required Tools

Building from sources requires everything you need for a 
[pip-based install](#install-with-pip) and more. 
Since bitstream is written in [Cython], at the very least
you need [a Cython compiler](install Cython).
If you don't mind having a few extra packags installed, 
it's easier to install all developer dependencies with:

    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

### Build and Install

Run the command:

    $ python setup.py --cython install

If you want to do more than just build bitstream from sources
-- for example run the tests, regenerate the documentation, etc. --
please refer to the [Contributing section](contributing).

Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

??? warning "The command `python setup.py install` doesn't work"

    This is expected:
    this command needs C files to build bitstream,
    which is a Python C extension module,
    but these files are not present in the git repository.
    They have first to be generated by the Cython compiler
    from the `.pyx` and `.pxd` files with:

        $ python setup.py --cython build

    To "solve" this issue, you can make the `--cython` option implicit
    with a `setup.cfg` file that contains:

        [global]
        cython = 1
